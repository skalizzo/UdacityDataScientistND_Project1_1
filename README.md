## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*. I've used the following libraries that are not contained within the standard library: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, seaborn.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is an Udacity Nanodegree project. I have chosen the Airbnb Seattle dataset from Kaggle. 

As a frequent Airbnb renter I found it interesting to to apply data analysis skills here. 

My key interests would be:

1. What are the most influential factors that influence the price of an Airbnb apartment?
2. What difference does it make if the host is considered a "superhost" by Airbnb?
3. What model is best suited to predict prices for this dataset?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

airbnb_seattle_listings.csv contains all Airbnb listings for Seattle from 2016. 

There is also a notebook available here to showcase all my work related to my three questions.



## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the [post](https://medium.com/p/fb185976fcd6/edit) available



## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Udacity courses (and Stackoverflow) for some of code ideas, and to Kaggle/AirBnb for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
